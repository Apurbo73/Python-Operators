#                                                    Operator Precedence

# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# Example
# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:

print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Parenthesis have the highest precedence, and need to be evaluated first.
# The calculation above reads 9 - 9 = 0


print(100 + 5 * 3)

# """
# Multiplication has higher precedence than addition, and needs to be evaluated first.
# The calculation above reads 100 + 15 = 115
